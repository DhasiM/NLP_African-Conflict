# Topic Modelling of Conflict on the African Continent from '97-'22

'[‘Little to lose’: Poverty and despair fuel South Africa’s unrest'](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/14/little-to-lose-poverty-and-despair-fuel-south-africas-unrest) reads an Aljazeera headline published on 14 Jul 2021. Are these words just another attention grabbing headline to sell papers or is there some truth to it? Does economic inequality fuel unrest? To answer this question would require a massive amount of data and computing power. What this notebbok attempts to do is scale down this question  to: Is there a pattern in the themes or topics of unrest across the African continent and do they at least have a linear relationship to a country's economic status? 

# Datasets
1. [ACLED](https://acleddata.com/about-acled/)
> The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) collects data on conflicts and unrest around the world. This project used ACLED data for Africa from 1997 t0 2022.
2. [WorldBank GDP annual growth](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?locations=ZG)
>  GDP gives information about the size of the economy and how an economy is performing and  is often used as an indicator of the general health of the economy. GDP annual growth rates for Sub Saharan Africa were used.
